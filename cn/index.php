					<p>"ISCTE bring us together" is the annual event that aims to bring together alumni of ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon from around the world.</p>
					<p>Since 1997 ISCTE develops an intense collaboration with Mozambique, initiated by the Centre for African Studies with the University Eduardo Mondlane. In 1999 began a series of thematic masterâ€™s in business management, accounting and finance that led 282 graduates in partnership with the Polytechnic University of Mozambique. In addition to approximately 500 Mozambican students who completed bachelor, master or doctorate in ISCTE-IUL. Our presence in Mozambique strengthened and we created the School of Business and Administration of Mozambique (ENAM) in partnership with ISUTC - Institute of Transport and Communications in 2013. </p>
					<p>On 29th and 30th November 2012 we invite all our alumni to join us in Maputo - Mozambique and meet fellow ISCTE alumni representatives from Portuguese Speaking Countries especially invited for the event. ISCTE offers a network of thousands of alumni from four continents; it is up to all of us to make it stronger and useful to leverage the links between East and West, North and South. </p>
					<p>We also thank our sponsors without whom this event would be of much less lustre.</p>
					<p>DEADLINE FOR REGISTRATION: November 15th, 2013. Please sign up and check the activities you wish to attend.
					Travel to Maputo and accommodation are to be paid by the participants themselves. There is no enrolment fee for this event.</p>
